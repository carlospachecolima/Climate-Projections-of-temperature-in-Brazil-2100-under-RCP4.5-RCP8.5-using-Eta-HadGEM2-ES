# Climate-Projections-of-temperature-in-Brazil-2100-under-RCP4.5-RCP8.5-using-Eta-HadGEM2-ES
This repository provides seasonal temperature maps for Brazil, based on the dynamically downscaled Eta‑HadGEM2‑ES model. It includes historical and future estimates (2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100) of minimum (Tmin), maximum (Tmax), and mean (Tmean) temperatures under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.

Introduction
Overview of the project scope: seasonal and temporal projections of Tmin, Tmax, Tmed for Brazil using Eta‑HadGEM2‑ES nested model under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.

Data Description
This repository contain the follow maps: 

Historical baseline and future slices (2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100).

Seasonal breakdown: Summer (DJF), Autumn (SON), Winter (JJA), Spring (MAM).

Methods
Model and downscaling: Eta‐HadGEM2‐ES validated for Brazil at ~20 km resolution obtained in the website (http://pclima.inpe.br/analise/) and processed by QGIS
